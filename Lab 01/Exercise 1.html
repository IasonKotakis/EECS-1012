<h1> Welcome to my first website</h1>
<h2> my name is Iason Kotakis</h2>
<p> I know EECS 1012 is a challenging course, and I need to <strong>engage</strong> really well in problem solving activities from the first week of calsses for every week </p>
<p>I have been told that if I treat 1012, 1022, 2030, and 2011 each as a 6-credit course, and really learn underlying concepts and skills, I will enjoy rest of my CS program. In fact <i>rest of my life! as long as  I am in the CS business.</i> </p>
